DevSoc Technical Interview Submission
Introduction
Dear DevSoc Team,

I am a second-year Software Engineering major with a passion for development. I have worked on several front-end projects in my free time and am eager to contribute to DevSoc. I am open to both front-end and back-end development, as I believe that the more I learn, the more I growâ€”so I am happy to take on challenges in either area!

Completed Tasks
Front-End Tasks: All completed. See instructions.txt for details on how to run the project using npm run dev.
Back-End Tasks: Completed Q2 and Q3.
Chaos Tasks: All completed.

Looking forward to your feedback!
Best regards,
Peter Nguyen
